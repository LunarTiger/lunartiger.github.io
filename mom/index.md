		<p>The moment you left me my heart split in two. One side with memories, the other side died with you.<br />I often lay awake at night when the world is fast asleep and take a walk down memory lane with tears upon my cheek.<br />Remembering you is easy. I do it everyday; but missing you is a heartache that never goes away.<br />I hold you tightly within my heart and there you will remain. As my life goes on without you, but will never be the same.</p>
		<p>Shelva Denise Washburn was a loving mother, wife, and a cherished friend to many. Her unexpected death on November 25, 2022 has left the hearts of the many people that knew her heavy with grief.</p>
